# Exploring How Work Affects Study Habits and Stress in College Students
This project was developed as part of CS105: Data Analysis Methods, at University of California, Riverside to explore the relationship between work schedules and their impact on college students' study habits, stress levels, and academic performance. Using survey data collected from students, the analysis addresses questions such as how work commitments influence study time, the role of AI tools in managing workloads, and the factors contributing to academic stress.

The study employs various statistical techniques, including Chi-Square tests for independence and correlation analysis, to identify significant patterns. The findings are visualized using diverse graphs, including bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, providing insights into how students balance work and academics.

Goals:
- Understand the relationship between working hours and study habits.
- Analyze stress patterns related to academic responsibilities and external commitments.
- Explore the integration of AI tools in academic settings.

This repository includes the dataset, analysis code, and visualizations created as part of the study.
